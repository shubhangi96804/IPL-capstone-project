# IPL-capstone-project
Python: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly) I perform IPL insights and visual storytelling:

   This project include :
  
   Combine and clean the relevant datasets
     
    Analyzing  run trends over the years.
     
    Comparing batting styles (anchor vs aggressive) via strike rate and boundary %
     
    Study bowling consistency (dot balls, economy rate, average)
     
    Visualizing performance in different overs (Powerplay, Death)
     
    Comparing venue behavior in high-scoring vs low-scoring matches.
